To accomplish this, we aim to maintain an inclusive and innovative environment. The project is not about replacing elisp with a more popular language like Javascript. We just want to make emacs more approachable for people who don't like lisp as much as we do. Contributions are welcome from anyone and we are always happy to invite new people to the project. We are open towards interesting ideas to make emacs better. Our only request is that you open an issue before starting work and be willing to take feedback from the core contributors. Why Emacs-ng # Emacs-ng is an additive native layer over emacs, bringing features like Deno's Javascript and Async I/O environment, Mozilla's Webrender (experimental opt-in feature), and other features in development. emacs-ng's approach is to utilize multiple new development approaches and tools to bring Emacs to the next level. emacs-ng is maintained by a team that loves Emacs and everything it stands for - being totally introspectable, with a fully customizable and free development environment. We want Emacs to be a editor 40+ years from now that has the flexibility and design to keep up with progressive technology. Why JavaScript # One of emacs-ng's primary features is integrating the Deno Runtime , which allows execution of JavaScript and Typescript within Emacs. The details of that feature are listed below, however many users would ask themselves WHY JAVASCRIPT? JavaScript is an extremely dynamic language that allows for a user to inspect and control their scripting environment. The key to note is that bringing in Deno isn't JUST JavaScript - it's an ecosystem of powerful tools and approaches that Emacs just doesn't have currently. TypeScript offers an extremely flexible typing system, that allows to user to have compile time control of their scripting, with the flexibility of types \"getting out of the way\" when not needed. Deno uses Google's v8 JavaScript engine, which features an extremely powerful JIT and world-class garbage collector. Usage of modern Async I/O utilizing Rust's Tokio library. Emacs-ng has WebWorker support, meaning that multiple JavaScript engines can be running in parallel within the editor. The only restriction is that only the 'main' JS Engine can directly call lisp functions. Emacs-ng also has WebAssembly support - compile your C module as WebAsm and distribute it to the world. Don't worry about packaging shared libraries or changing module interfaces, everything can be handled and customized by you the user, at the scripting layer. No need to be dependent on native implementation details. Performance # v8's world-class JIT offers the potential for large performance gains. Async I/O from Deno, WebWorkers, and WebAsm, gives you the tools to make Emacs a smoother and faster experience without having to install additional tools to launch as background processes or worry about shared library versions.

WebWorkers # One of the big draws of emacs-ng is parallel scripting. You may or may not be familiar with the fact that vanilla emacs had lisp threads that you could create via (make-thread FUNC) . Lisp threads were concurrent, but not parallel. In addition to that limitation, lisp threads that were not the 'main thread' would only execute at specific times during emacs event loop. WebWorkers give you parallelism. Under the hood, they are spinning up a Rust std::thread (in C terms, this is analogous to a pthread). Due to this, there is a limited interface to exchange data between threads. Building up the WebWorker # We will start by creating the JavaScript our WebWorker will execute. Create a file named \"web-worker.js\" and insert the following: self . onmessage = ( input ) => { let { message } = input . data ; message += \" And My Axe \" ; self . postMessage ({ message }); self . close (); }; WebWorkers communicate via two special functions, postMessage and onmessage. onmessage will be called once our parent thread sends us a message, while we can use postMessage to send data back to the main thread. This example is appending a string to its input and handing that back to the main thread. We also called the close function, meaning that this WebWorker is \"one and done\", and will shut down once it has performed this operation a single time. If we did not call close, the worker would stay alive and await additional messages. Using our WebWorker # Create a new file with the following code: declare var lisp : any ; const worker = new Worker ( new URL ( \"web-worker.js\" , import . meta . url ). href , { type : \"module\" , deno : true , }); worker . onmessage = ( output ) => { const { message } = output . data ; // This is safe because our callback is back // on the main thread. lisp . print ( message ); } worker . postMessage ({ message : \"You have my sword .... \" }); This code spins up our WebWorker and passes it a message. Running this code with eval-ts-buffer should print a reference to a cool little obscure movie in your minibuffer. Using Deno with WebWorkers # WebWorkers do not have access to elisp functions - you will notice that if you attempt to use the lisp object you will get an error that it is not defined. However, WebWorkers do have full access to Deno. The recommended usage for WebWorkers is to Identify the slow or blocking portion of your existing or new elisp code Write your webworker to perform the operation and data manipulation and translate the results to a format that elisp will be able to use. I.e. if you want to walk a directory and return all files ending in \"foo\", perform that logic and construct the array on your WebWorker, and send that array to your main thread via sendMessage. Once your mainThread receives that information, you can call your elisp code to display it. It's recommended to avoid WebWorkers for pure I/O or subprocess operations. Instead, use Deno's built in async I/O capabilities outlined in their documentation . You should use WebWorkers when you have significant calculation or operation to perform on the returned data. An example would be: Don't use a webworker to just run git status . You may want to use a WebWorker if you are running git status, opening each file, and performing complex logic on each line of the file, and then returning a list of strings back to lisp for display. You can see their example for spawning a subprocess to see what the platform is capable of. This can allow for things normally handled by tramp -> you could ssh into a box, get a list of files, and then actually perform scripting logic on that result prior to passing it back to lisp for display. Current elisp can handle about half of that, however once ssh, or whatever process returns those results, any logic on the subprocesses output will be blocking the editor. You can also reference this module as another example.","title":"Advanced features"},{"location":"adv-features/#advanced-features","text":"This section assumes you have completed \"Getting Started\" and \"Using Deno\" and have a basic familiarization with the elisp JavaScript API.","title":"Advanced Features"},{"location":"adv-features/#webworkers","text":"One of the big draws of emacs-ng is parallel scripting.

JavaScript # The majority of JavaScript related code is located in rust_src/src/javascript.rs. There is a lot to unpack on this file, but I will attempt to unpack the core concepts: EmacsMainJsRuntime # This is a thread local singleton containing the JavaScript runtime and associated state. The two major fields in this struct are the Tokio runtime and the MainWorker. The choice to make this a thread local struct was due to the fact that Emacs has the ability to spawn threads via (make-thread), but v8 isolates do not like being shared between threads without using a specific API. We lean heavily on Deno's MainWorker class, which is also not designed to be shared between threads, so we made the choice to just stay threadlocal. The oddity here is that in the case of calling make-thread, the lisp threads will have their lisp variables will shared, but not their JavaScript variables. Tokio # The Tokio runtime is what is driving all JavaScript Async I/O and timers. Tokio maintains its own threadpool on which tasks are enqueued. This is all \"behind the scenes\" to any emacs-ng code. The system is designed with the assumption that emacs-ng code will not have to call tokio::spawn or tokio::spawn_blocking. MainWorker # The \"MainWorker\" is a Deno concept. It encapsulates their module loader, file cache, and most importantly, the \"JsRuntime\". The JsRuntime encapsules the v8::Isolate, which can be described as the true, actual \"JavaScript Runtime\". Interfacing with the v8::Isolate is ultimately how JavaScript will be run. There are a few instances where we call execute using the isolate directly. The MainWorker has some key restrictions included by design - if you have a top level module promise rejection, the Worker will panic upon the next attempt to execute JavaScript. The worker cannot handle cases where execute is called \"deep\" within the callstack. Meaning that if I call lisp -> javascript -> lisp -> JavaScript, I cannot depend on the Worker's execute method. We will have an entire section dedicated to that fact. The EmacsMainJsRuntime is thread local because of the MainWorker - it is not Send nor Sync. The v8::Isolate, which is contained within the MainWorker, cannot be shared between threads by design. A quirk of this is that if you spawn a lisp thread, it has its own JavaScript runtime. This means that while the thread shares lisp globals, it does not share javaScript globals. Event Loop # A core concept to JavaScript is the event loop. All JS invocations in emacs-ng start with a call to \"run_module\". run_module will eventually call into the MainWorkers execute method, which in turn calls into the v8::Isolate's execute method - are you starting to see the pattern? Once you call run_module, you will begin to execute JavaScript. Doing so may enqueue async events, like setTimeout, fetch, etc. These are all things that Deno calls async_ops or sync_ops . They have a system to manage ops. We have a policy that emacs-ng will not add ops, or deal with the ops API. If you want to add native functionality to emacs-ng, you should directly bind the function, like with lisp_callback and friends. As these async events execute in the background, we will poll for their completion. In order to integrate with Emacs program loop, we set a timer, calling a function named js-tick-event-loop . This function is really just a wrapper around Deno's poll_event_loop . For performance reasons, js-tick-event-loop can call poll_event_loop multiple times. The user does have control of this behavior via js_set_tick_rate . In general, we want to give the user full control of emacs-ng, including how the JavaScript environment is configured. Proxies and Garbage Collector (GC) Interoperability # JavaScript has a concept of a 'Proxy' object, which we use in emacs-ng, however this section is about our JS <--> elisp marshalling. We refer to that as 'proxying' within internal documentation. For example, we will discuss how this code actually works: const buffer = lisp . get_buffer_create ( '*foo*' ); lisp . set_current_buffer ( buffer ); lisp . insert ( \"FOOBAR\" ); The Lisp Object # The lisp object is a JavaScript Capital-P Proxy . When you access lisp.get_buffer_create , it returns a function that does something like: (... args ) => lisp_invoke ( 'get-buffer-create' ... args ); lisp_invoke is a native function defined in javascript.rs. It's a wrapper around ffuncall with logic for object translation. It will also catch any lisp errors and translates them to JavaScript errors. lisp_invoke returns a JavaScript object - but this is a 'special object' in that it may have an internal field. Internal fields are data objects that are contained within JavaScript objects that are not accessible by the user. This is because LispObjects are just pointers - if we let the user alter pointers, they could cause SEGFAULTS or read arbitrary memory. If we can parse the result of lisp_invoke as JSON, we do not proxy it. Instead we return the JavaScript equivalent (i.e. a JS string or number). However, if we cannot convert it to JSON, like in the case of a buffer, we return a proxy. Functions (i.e. (lambda () (...)) ) are another special case where additional logic is employed. lisp_invoke also works in reverse when being called, it will unproxy the arguments it is passed in order to further pass them to ffuncall . We expose a special function called is_proxy in order to tell if an object is a proxy. GC Usage # When we create a proxy, we need to properly manage it in the lisp garbage collector. We do not want lisp to GC an object out from underneath us. In order to do this, we need to make two considerations for each direction of JS -> Lisp and Lisp -> JS To prevent the lisp GC from removing objects that JS has a valid reference to, we include them in a special cons called the js-retain-map . The user does not have direct access to this object. Allowing them to access this cons would allow mutation in a way that could lead to use after free bugs. When a proxy is created in JavaScript, we create a special JavaScript object called a WeakRef . This is documented here . Once an object has no outstanding references (besides the WeakRef itself) the WeakRef will return undefined once accessed. We maintain a global array of WeakRefs for all proxies that we sweep every time lisp performs its garbage collection. We map this array to the js-retain-map . The end result is that if you have an object in JavaScript that is a proxy, it will always be valid. elisp does not have proxies, it will only receive valid lisp objects from JavaScript, so this problem does not exist in the opposite direction. Lambda Usage # Users will notice that lambas will auto convert between JS and elisp. Example: lisp.run_with_timer ( 1 , lisp.symbols.nil, () => console.log ( 'This works... ' )) ; How does this work under the hood? When we go to create a proxy, we will test if that object is a function. If so, we will include it in another special array for functions. We will then create the following lisp object representing that lambda: ( lambda ( &REST ) ( js--reenter INDEX ( make-finalizer ( lambda () js--clear INDEX )) REST )) Index is hard-coded per lambda object, i.e. js--reenter 1 ... . Calling this lambda will call js--reenter, which is just calling the function in the array at INDEX. In order to ensure that function will be garbage collected, we add a lisp finalizer, which will clear the lambda from the array upon GC.","title":"Native Hackers Handbook (Architecture)"},{"location":"architecture/#emacs-ng-native-hackers-handbook","text":"The purpose of this document is to outline how emacs-ng's native changes work.","title":"Emacs-ng Native Hacker's Handbook"},{"location":"architecture/#javascript","text":"The majority of JavaScript related code is located in rust_src/src/javascript.rs.

Build requirements # You will need Rust installed . The file rust-toolchain indicates the version that gets installed. This happens automatically, so don't override the toolchain manually. IMPORTANT: Whenever the toolchain updates, you have to reinstall rustfmt manually. Linux # You will need a C compiler and toolchain. On Linux, you can do something like: apt install build-essential automake clang libclang-dev Additional requirements: apt install texinfo libjpeg-dev libtiff-dev \\ libgif-dev libxpm-dev libgtk-3-dev gnutls-dev \\ libncurses5-dev libxml2-dev libxt-dev For native-comp you will also need zlib1g-dev libgccjit-9-dev . MacOS # On macOS, you'll need Xcode. brew install gnutls texinfo autoconf To use the installed version of makeinfo instead of the built-in ( /usr/bin/makeinfo ) one, you'll need to make sure /usr/local/opt/texinfo/bin is before /usr/bin in PATH . Mojave install libxml2 headers with: open /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg If you want to use native-comp, you will need to compile with ./configure --with-native-compilation . nativecomp will also require: brew install zlib libgccjit It seems to be more difficult to build native-comp on macOS than on linux. There are several tutorials that provide instructions on how to successfully compile it(no guarantee that they work): https://gist.github.com/mikroskeem/0a5c909c1880408adf732ceba6d3f9ab https://gist.github.com/AllenDang/f019593e65572a8e0aefc96058a2d23e Compile and install # $ ./autogen.sh $ ./configure --enable-rust-debug $ make -j 8 # or your number of cores For a release build, don't pass --enable-rust-debug . The Makefile obeys cargo's RUSTFLAGS variable and additional options can be passed to cargo with CARGO_FLAGS.

C-x C-f means hold down control, press x, keep holding control, press f. Requirements # You will need Rust installed . The file rust-toolchain indicates the version that gets installed. This happens automatically, so don't override the toolchain manually. IMPORTANT: Whenever the toolchain updates, you have to reinstall rustfmt manually. You also need a working installation of emacs-ng. You can either build it or install a precompiled binary distribution from our CI . Running JavaScript # Type in the following line and press C-j ( eval-js \"lisp.print('hello world!')\" ) This will display \"hello world\" in your display area (along with 'nil' - we will get to that). This is an anonymous javascript evaluation. Before we go further, let\u2019s make an environment for working with our new scripting language. We have multiple ways to run JavaScript. Let us open a new TypeScript file by creating a file name \"basic.ts\" in our current directory. It will look something like: declare var lisp : any ; let x : string = \"Hello TypeScript\" ; lisp . print ( x ); Now we go back to *scratch* and run ( eval-js-file \"./basic.ts\" ) This is a relative filepath, and it works off of emacs current working directory (cwd). If you are in doubt to what emacs cwd is, just run the lisp function (pwd) in the lisp scratchpad You should see \"Hello TypeScript\" printed. All of the eval-js* functions return nil. If you want to use a calculated value from JavaScript in Lisp, you should use eval-js-literally . If you are looking for something like eval-expression , which is normally bound to M-:, you should use eval-js-expression . It accepts the same arguments as eval-expression , except with the first argument being a JavaScript expression, and behaves very similarly to eval-expression . It will also inserts the results into values just like eval-expression . eval-js-literally and eval-js-expression do not work with TypeScript at this time. Iteration # Now that we have our TypeScript file, let us get out of lisp and work purely in TypeScript. Open \"basic.ts\" by pressing C-x C-f and open \"basic.ts\". Press M-x and enter \"eval-ts-buffer\". This will evaluate the current contents of your buffer as typescript. You should see \"Hello Typescript\" print in your minibuffer. From now on, this will be our preferred way to iterate. If you do not want to evaluate the entire buffer, you can press C-space, highlight a region of code, and press M-x eval-ts-region. Try that with this code and see what happens: let y : string = 3 ; You will see the following error in your minibuffer: TS2322 [ ERROR ] : Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string' . let y: string = 3 ; ^ at file:///home/user/ $anon$lisp$91610855413 .ts:1:5TS2322 It's important to understand that your TypeScript code is compiled prior to execution - unlike standard JavaScript which is evaluated until you encounter a runtime error. Within emacs-ng, that means that your code isn't executed if you have a type error in TypeScript. If these typescript examples are taking a long time to evaluate, it's likely due to the processing power required to compile everything. If you want to turn off TypeScript typechecking for the remainder of the examples, you can run: ( js-cleanup ) ( js-initialize :no-check t ) This code will cleanup your current JS environment and re-initialize it with TypeScript type checking disabled. If you do not care about the type checking that TypeScript offers, or your computer struggles with the cost of compiling, you can add (js-initialize :no-check t) to your init.el. Let's stop printing to the minibuffer, and instead start pushing our results into buffers. Let's start by something simple: make a network call and dump the results into a buffer. Buffers # First thing first, let's make our network call. In order to do this, we will use our built-in Deno APIs . Deno implements fetch , which looks something like this: declare var lisp : any ; fetch ( \"https://api.github.com/users/denoland\" ) . then ( response => response . json ()) . catch ( e => lisp . print ( JSON . stringify ( e ))); fetch is a common API documented here . It returns a Promise , which is a tool we will use to manage async I/O operations. Here, the network call isn't blocking, and it managed by our Rust runtime called Tokio. The .then is saying that once this promise is resolved, execute the next function in the chain. We have added a .catch , which will be executed if fetch errors. NOTE: If you have an unhandled toplevel promise rejection, the JavaScript runtime will RESET. You should always have a toplevel promise handler within any emacs-ng code. We will see the way we can interface with lisp error handling further on. However we want to put this response into a buffer. In order to do this, we will extend our .then chain, like so declare var lisp : any ; fetch ( \"https://api.github.com/users/denoland\" ) . then ( response => response . json ()) . then (( data ) => { const buffer = lisp . get_buffer_create ( \"TypeScript Buffer\" ); lisp . with_current_buffer ( buffer , () => lisp . insert ( JSON . stringify ( data ))); }) . catch ( e => lisp . print ( JSON . stringify ( e ))); Wait for the network call to resolve, and navigate to \"TypeScript Buffer\" via C-x b and typing in \"TypeScript Buffer\", or pressing C-x C-b and selecting our buffer from the buffer list. By now, you may be wondering about this lisp object, and how we are able to get references to lisp objects from JavaScript. Our next example should illustrate this further. Filewatching # Let's write an async filewatch that logs changes to a directory into a buffer, with a little extra data. In order to do this, we will use Deno's standard library. Deno has built in functions like fetch , along with a robust standard library that you need to import. That will look like this: declare var lisp : any ; // This will allow us to write const insertIntoTypeScriptBuffer = ( str : string ) => { const buffer = lisp . get_buffer_create ( \"TypeScript Filewatching\" ); lisp . with_current_buffer ( buffer , () => lisp . insert ( ` ${ str } \\n` )); }; async function watch ( dir : string ) { const watcher = Deno . watchFs ( dir ); let i = 0 ; for await ( const event of watcher ) { i += 1 ; if ( i > 5 ) break ; insertIntoTypeScriptBuffer ( JSON . stringify ( event )); } } watch ( '.' ) This example is built to only record 5 events prior to ending itself. You can write whatever logic you would like for ending your filewatcher. running touch foo.ts in your current directory should yield something like the following in the \"TypeScript Filewatching\" buffer { \"kind\" : \"create\" , \"paths\" :[ \"/home/user/./foo.ts\" ]} { \"kind\" : \"modify\" , \"paths\" :[ \"/home/user/./foo.ts\" ]} { \"kind\" : \"access\" , \"paths\" :[ \"/home/user/./foo.ts\" ]} Deno has further documentation on this . Note that these events can differ per operating system. A few key take aways here - all of the TypeScript written above is executed on the Main elisp thread - there are no race conditions with lisp here. Even though the filewatcher is async, it calls back onto the mainthread when it has data. Multithreaded scripting is possible and will be covered later on. Modules # Now let's look at our tools for importing code. emacs-ng supports ES6 modules . emacs-ng does not support node's require syntax. See the \"Using Deno\" section for more information on modules. Let's create a submodule for our main program. Create a file named \"mod-sub.js\": export function generateRandomNumber () { return 4 ; } Now in our main file, we can add the following to the top of our file: import { generateRandomNumber } from \"./mod-sub.js\" ; declare var lisp : any ; lisp . print ( generateRandomNumber ()); Even though our module is TypeScript, we can still import plain old JavaScript. It's important to note that ES6 modules are supposed to be immutable. What does that mean? If we were to edit mod-js to include the following: export function generateRandomNumber () { return 4 ; } lisp . print ( generateRandomNumber ()); We see that in addition to exporting a function, we execute code with side-effects (printing). Those side-effects only happen once . If I import mod-sub multiple times, I will only ever see \"4\" printed once. Another important note is that this rule does not apply to any toplevel module you execute . Meaning that if you call (eval-js-file \"./basic.ts\") multiple times, your code is executed every single time, however your dependencies are only executed once. This is by design. If you want to break this, you can append a number to your dependency and use so-called dynamic importing , like so: declare var lisp : any ; let timestamp : number = Date . now (); const { generateRandomNumber } = await import ( `./mod-sub.js# ${ timestamp } ` ); lisp . print ( generateRandomNumber ()); This can be useful if you are a module developer and you want to iterate on your modules within emacs-ng. It is recommended that you do not ship your modules using this pattern, as it will not cache results properly and lead to a susoptimal user experience. Your imports should aim to not have side effects, and instead should only export functions or variables to be used by your main module. The intended use of Dynamic Importing is to allow you to have condition imports, like so: if ( myCondition ) { const { func } = await import ( 'example-mod.js' ); func (); } Lisp Interaction # The lisp object is magic - it has (almost) all lisp functions defined on it, including any functions defined in your custom packages. If you can invoke it via (funcall ....) , you can call it via the lisp object if you change - for _ . For example: (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create \"BUFFER\") (lambda () (insert \"DATA\"))) becomes lisp . with_current_buffer ( lisp . get_buffer_create ( \"BUFFER\" ), () => lisp . insert ( \"DATA\" )); We have implementations of common macros like with-current-buffer . If you find that a certain common macro doesn't work, you can report it to the project's maintainers and they will implement it, however what they are doing isn't magic - they are just calling eval on your whatever macro you want to invoke from JavaScript. lisp . eval ( lisp . list ( lisp . symbols . with_current_buffer , arg1 , arg2 )); You can override the behavior of the lisp object via the special object specialForms , which looks like lisp . specialForms . with_current_buffer = myWithCurrentBufferFunction ; This overrides JavaScript's implementation of with_current_buffer without touching lisp's implementation. Let's discuss working with lisp more: Lisp Primitives # Primitives (Number, String, Boolean) are automatically translated when calling lisp functions lisp . my_function ( 1.0 , 2 , \"MYSTRING\" , false ) If you need to access a symbol or keyword, you will use the symbol keyword objects const mySymbol = lisp . symbols . foo ; // foo const myKeyword = lisp . keywords . foo ; // :foo You can create more complex objects via the make object const hashtable = lisp . make . hashtable ({ x : 3 , y : 4 }); const alist = lisp . make . alist ({ x : lisp.symbols.bar , y : \"String\" }); const plist = lisp . make . plist ({ zz : 19 , zx : false }); const array = lisp . make . array ([ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ]); const list = lisp . make . list ([ 1 , 5 , \"String\" , lisp . symbols . x ]); const lstring = lisp . make . string ( \"MyString\" ); Errors # If a lisp function would trigger (error ...) in lisp, it will throw an error in javascript. An example: try { lisp . cons (); // No arguments } catch ( e ) { lisp . print ( JSON . stringify ( e )); } Defining Lisp Functions # We can also define functions that can be called via lisp. We will use defun to accomplish this: declare var lisp : any ; const insertIntoTypeScriptBuffer = ( str : string ) => { const buffer = lisp . get_buffer_create ( \"TypeScript Filewatching\" ); lisp . with_current_buffer ( buffer , () => lisp . insert ( str )); }; lisp . defun ({ name : \"my-function\" , docString : \"My Example Function\" , interactive : true , args : \"MInput\" , func : ( str : string ) => insertIntoTypeScriptBuffer ( str ) }); This defines a lisp function named my-function . We can call this function from lisp (my-function STRING) , in JavaScript via lisp.my_function(STRING) , or call it interactively. That means that within the editor if we press M-x and type \"my-function\", we can invoke the function. It will then perform our JavaScript action, which is to insert whatever text we enter into our TypeScript Buffer. Conclusion # This covers the basic of calling lisp functions and I/O using Deno. Together using these tools you can already build powerful apps, or allow emacs-ng to perform actions. In our next series we will cover more advanced topics like Threading and WebASM.","title":"Getting started"},{"location":"getting-started/#getting-started","text":"This is an introduction for building applications and hacking on emacs-ng using JavaScript. emacs-ng supports both TypeScript and JavaScript, so these examples will feature both languages.

Create a file named \"mod-sub.js\": export function generateRandomNumber () { return 4 ; } Now in our main file, we can add the following to the top of our file: import { generateRandomNumber } from \"./mod-sub.js\" ; declare var lisp : any ; lisp . print ( generateRandomNumber ()); Even though our module is TypeScript, we can still import plain old JavaScript. It's important to note that ES6 modules are supposed to be immutable. What does that mean? If we were to edit mod-js to include the following: export function generateRandomNumber () { return 4 ; } lisp . print ( generateRandomNumber ()); We see that in addition to exporting a function, we execute code with side-effects (printing). Those side-effects only happen once . If I import mod-sub multiple times, I will only ever see \"4\" printed once. Another important note is that this rule does not apply to any toplevel module you execute . Meaning that if you call (eval-js-file \"./basic.ts\") multiple times, your code is executed every single time, however your dependencies are only executed once. This is by design. If you want to break this, you can append a number to your dependency and use so-called dynamic importing , like so: declare var lisp : any ; let timestamp : number = Date . now (); const { generateRandomNumber } = await import ( `./mod-sub.js# ${ timestamp } ` ); lisp . print ( generateRandomNumber ()); This can be useful if you are a module developer and you want to iterate on your modules within emacs-ng. It is recommended that you do not ship your modules using this pattern, as it will not cache results properly and lead to a susoptimal user experience. Your imports should aim to not have side effects, and instead should only export functions or variables to be used by your main module. The intended use of Dynamic Importing is to allow you to have condition imports, like so: if ( myCondition ) { const { func } = await import ( 'example-mod.js' ); func (); }","title":"Modules"},{"location":"getting-started/#lisp-interaction","text":"The lisp object is magic - it has (almost) all lisp functions defined on it, including any functions defined in your custom packages.

Both Deno and nodejs were created by the same person, Ryan Dhal. While normally you would invoke Deno via the command line, the emacs-ng project has integrated the Deno runtime into the emacs-ng client directly. Deno is powered by v8, Chrome's Open Source JavaScript engine. A JavaScript engine is more limited then most users realize. For example, utilities like XMLHttpRequest are not provided directly by the JavaScript engine, but are instead provided by a runtime (like your browser). Deno provides interfaces for performing I/O operations like file reads/writes, network operations, and spawning subprocesses. By default, emacs-ng will allow reading, writing, network, and subprocess operations. In Deno's examples, you may see them advise you to pass flags like \"--allow-net\". These are not needed when executing emacs-ng code. If you want to globally disable any of the previously mentioned operations, you can run the following lisp prior to executing JavaScript: (js-initialize :allow-net nil :allow-read nil :allow-write nil :allow-run nil) You can define any combination of the above arguments. See js-initialize's documentation for more information. General Documentation / Standard Library # Deno has excellent documentation . This guide is to give you a basic familiarity with Deno to allow you to quickly write applications, but is FAR from all inclusive. Deno maintains a powerful standard library at https://deno.land/std@0.83.0 . Importing a deno std module is simple: just include this in your JavaScript file/buffer: Credit to https://deno.land/std@0.83.0/fs for the example: import { copy , copySync } from \"https://deno.land/std@0.83.0/fs/mod.ts\" ; copy ( \"./foo\" , \"./bar\" ); // returns a promise copySync ( \"./foo\" , \"./bar\" ); // void copySync ( \"./foo\" , \"./existingFolder\" , { overwrite : true }); The first thing you may notice is that we are importing a URL, not a local filepath. Deno allows you to download dependencies from the network. This file will only be downloaded once and compiled once, and it's results will be cached on your local file system. After initial download, you will use your local filesystem's copy instead of using the network. By default, all Deno API's are asynchronous . Almost all async operations have an alternate version that is synchronous. That means that when you make a call to read a file, or walk a directory, it is returning a Promise. Deno has the naming convention that the synchronous versions all end in \" Sync\". A common point of confusion with emacs-ng is that when you evaluate a file, a buffer, or even an anonymous block in JavaScript via (eval-js) , you are executing your code within a JavaScript module with toplevel await enabled. What does that mean? If you invoke await within your toplevel module, you will block the main thread until completion. Looking again with our example above with that in mind: import { copy } from \"https://deno.land/std@0.83.0/fs/mod.ts\" ; // This block the main thread, including lisp execution, until this action is completed await copy ( \"./foo\" , \"./bar\" ); // This does not block JavaScript or Lisp, instead our .then will be executed once // the async action is complete. copy ( \"./foo\" , \"./bar\" ). then (() => console . log ( \"Complete\" )); Remember that async/await in JavaScript is just syntax sugar over Promises. There may be times where you want to use the toplevel await functionality to block on a promise at a certain time. Distribution # Once you have created your great emacs-ng module, how do you distribute it? Normally you would go through a repository like ELPA or MELPLA. While that is still a possibility, you have a third option, which is Deno's user modules . Navigating to the link below gives you the information on the upload process, but in the author's opinion, it is very simple and streamlined. Once your module is uploaded, you can have your user's include a line similar to this in their init.el (eval-js \"import 'https://deno.land/x/fuzzy_search@0.3.0/mod-fuzzy.js'\") Where instead of fuzzy_search@0.3.0/mod-fuzzy.js, you instead have your module version and filename. Using emacs as deno # emacs-ng offers the deno function in elisp, which allows users to leverage whatever deno offers from the command line. For example, you can run deno's repl (with elisp functions) by running the following: emacs --batch --eval '(deno \"repl\")' You can use deno's formatter by running emacs --batch --eval '(deno \"fmt\")' You could even run a script via emacs --batch --eval '(deno \"run\" \"--allow-read\" \"test.ts\")' Note you need to specify read/write/etc. permissions. Think of this as if you were using emacs AS deno. The deno function takes the exact same flags as the deno application. It's designed for use in batch mode on the command line, however it can also be used in regular elisp.
